### Changed

- The Account Update ([PUT /account](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#account-update)) endpoint `zip` property has been updated with new restrictions. Previously, the `zip` only had a 16 character limit. Now, `zip` may only consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens, and must not contain more than 9 letter or number characters. These conditions must also be when accessing the Credit Card Add/Edit ([POST /account/credit-card](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#credit-card-addedit)) endpoint.

### Fixed

- Previously, users without read-write access to Longview Clients could still access their `api_key` and `install_code` when accessing the Longview Clients List ([GET /longview/clients](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/#longview-clients-list)) and Longview Client View ([GET /longview/clients/{clientId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/#longview-client-view)) endpoints. Now, `[REDACTED]` is returned for these properties for users without read-write access to the associated Longview Clients.
